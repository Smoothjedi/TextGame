A text game where you need to find your keys to get inside before you die of dehydration

## Overview:
Waking up outside on your deck after a party the previous night, you realize you are extremely dehydrated after sleeping in the sun all morning. The goal is to get back inside to relax and recuperate! 

## Locations:
1. **Your deck**:You woke up here without your shoes. The beginning and potentially end of your adventure, but, unfortunately, the back door is a sliding one and the bar is down.
2. **Your front yard**: Severely damaged area, except the front door to your house. That's working fine, and it's locked.
3. **Your side yard**: Who uses the side yard anyways? You certainly don't, and it shows. Contains lots of overgrown foilage, and since apparently no one decided to use the trashcan, broken bottles litter the ground. Not safe to search in without shoes and gloves.
4. **Your backyard**: A depressingly small space that shows off your lack of a green thumb. It's become a mudpit, potentially concealing something important.
## Inventory items:
1. Your **left shoe**: Not immediately obvious where exactly this went; a good place to search may be the backyard.
2. Your **right shoe**: You have a faint recollection of possibly losing this in the front yard.
3. Your **work gloves**: You usually keep these hanging up over your deck for miscellaneous projects.
4. Your **house key**: It's anyone's guess where this went, which is disappointing since that's what you are missing to get inside. Might be worth checking the side yard, but it's treacherous over there.
## Goal state:
1. Well, you could kick the front door down, but you've already got enough damage to your yard and house to not make that economically feasible. Plus, your strength is waning from being dehydrated. Find your house key so you can get to the front yard and subsequently inside before you succumb to the elements!
